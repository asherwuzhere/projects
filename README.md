- **Growth-Adjusted F-Score** – modifies F-Score to account for expansion.
- **Comprehensive F-Score Tool** – large-scale ranking of companies using F-Score.
- **Comprehensive Magic Formula Tool** – large-scale ranking of companies using Magic Formula.
- **Input F-Score Tool** – command-line input for custom analysis.
- **Input Magic Formula Tool** – command-line input for Magic Formula.
- **Older Versions** – earlier iterations of both F-Score and Magic Formula tools.

- **Poker Assistant** – hand strength calculator.
- **Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe** – solver for the classic game.
- **Wordle Solvers** – dynamic vs. static letter weighting strategies to solve Wordle on hard-mode.

### Misc
Data files used by the other projects.
- **Market Data Collectors** – scripts to gather and prepare S&P 500 metrics.
- **Ticker List** – compiled list of S&P 500 companies.
- **Wordle Word List** – source of valid Wordle solutions.

### Other Projects
Smaller experiments and learning exercises.
- **Large Exponent Calculator** – converts big powers to scientific notation.
- **Fake Loading Screen** – visual effect for games.
- **Guessing Game** – simple number guessing logic.
- **Password Strength Checker** – evaluates security of given inputs.
- **Roman Numeral Converter** – integers to Roman numerals and back.

## Projects Overview

### AI
Experiments with artificial intelligence and helper bots.
- **Reinforcement Learning Backgammon** – neural agent trained with TensorFlow.
- **Talking Number Guesser** – interactive guessing game with AI voice.
- **Basic Local Chatbot** – minimal interface for Llama-based models.
- **Task Assistant** – tool for summarization and brainstorming.
- **Coding Helper Bot** – AI debugger and code converter.
- **Stock Prediction Network** – TensorFlow model for forecasting market moves.

### Finance API
Tools that analyse market data using `yfinance` and `pandas`.
- **Magic Formula Screener** – ranks S&P 500 companies by Joel Greenblatt’s formula.
- **Piotroski F-Score Analyzer** – evaluates financial health of custom tickers.
- **Batch F-Score Evaluator** – calculates scores across large symbol sets.
- **Combined Screeners** – integrates EBIT/EV and ROIC with Piotroski metrics.
- **Fixed Assets Variant** – adapts Magic Formula using asset-based measures.
- **Growth-Adjusted F-Score** – modifies F-Score to account for expansion.
- **Comprehensive F-Score Tool** – full implementation for hundreds of firms.
- **Comprehensive Magic Formula Tool** – large-scale ranking of companies.
- **Interactive F-Score Tool** – command-line input for custom analysis.
- **Interactive Magic Formula Tool** – user-driven valuation analyzer.
- **Legacy Versions** – earlier iterations of both F-Score and Magic Formula tools.

### Game Bots
Scripts that provide simple AIs or utilities for popular games.
- **Backgammon Bots** – heuristic move generators with doubling cube logic.
- **Blackjack Advisors** – probability-based recommendations for play.
- **File Sorter** – organizes code by category automatically.
- **Poker Assistant** – hand strength calculator with strategy hints.
- **Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe** – deterministic solver for the classic game.
- **Wordle Solvers** – dynamic vs. static letter weighting strategies.

### Misc
Utilities and data files used by the other projects.
- **Market Data Collectors** – scripts to gather and prepare S&P 500 metrics.
- **Ticker List** – compiled list of S&P 500 companies.
- **Wordle Word List** – source of valid Wordle solutions.

### Other Projects
Smaller experiments and learning exercises.
- **Large Exponent Calculator** – converts big powers to scientific notation.
- **Fake Loading Screen** – visual effect for games.
- **Guessing Game** – simple number guessing logic.
- **Password Strength Checker** – evaluates security of given inputs.
- **Roman Numeral Converter** – integers to Roman numerals and back.
- **Mini-Games Collection** – casual games like Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- **Placeholder Script** – small test utility.
- **Mock Weather App** – fake forecasts with jokes.
- **Real Weather Checker** – asynchronous weather fetcher using APIs.
